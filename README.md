**Description:** 
              In this PowerBI project, I've created a comprehensive sales performance report that provides insightful visualizations and analytics to analyze sales trends and performance. Here's an overview of the key features and functionalities:

**Data Transformation and Modeling:** 
              Before diving into calculations and visuals, I ensured that the provided data underwent the necessary transformations and was appropriately modeled to facilitate accurate analysis.

**Key Metrics:** 
              The report calculates and displays essential metrics such as total sales, total profit, order quantity, and total products, providing a holistic view of sales performance.

**Monthly Sales Trend:**  
              Utilizing a line chart, I've illustrated the monthly sales trend, allowing stakeholders to identify patterns and seasonal fluctuations.

**Weekly Sales Trend**: 
              A column chart is employed to showcase the weekly sales trend, offering a more granular view of sales performance over shorter time intervals.

**Top 10 Products Analysis:** 
              A matrix visual or table is utilized to present the top 10 products based on order quantity and total sales, aiding in identifying high-performing products.

**Sales by Brand Name**: 
              A horizontal bar chart is employed to depict sales distribution across different brand names, enabling insights into brand performance.

**Sales by Product Category:**  
              Another horizontal bar chart is used to visualize sales by product category, facilitating analysis of category-wise sales distribution.

**Interactive Filters:**  
              The report incorporates interactive filters for date, product category, and state, empowering users to dynamically explore and drill down into specific aspects of sales data.

**Regional Sales Analysis:** 
              dditionally, a separate page is dedicated to regional sales analysis, depicting sales by state and other relevant analytics, enabling stakeholders to understand regional variations and make informed decisions.
